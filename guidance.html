        Benefits Of Sports And Recreation
      </h3>
      <p>
        Sports and Recreation provides us with many health benefits! Regular
        physical activity reduces the risk of many health issues such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Heart disease</li>
        <li>Stroke</li>
        <li>Reduced blood pressure</li>
        <li>Prevention of certain cancers</li>
        <li>Reduced risk of becoming overweight</li>
        <li>Improved muscle strength, flexibility, and endurance</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Physical activity can also provide social benefits such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Increased confidence</li>
        <li>Reduced depression and anxiety</li>
        <li>Improved quality of life</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Physical activity also benefits students because active students have a
        higher capacity to learn and be productive than students who are not
        physically active.
      </p>
      <p>
        The communal experiences from belonging to a team in a sport also brings
        long term and short term benefits like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Learning to trust and depend on others</li>
        <li>Accepting and giving help</li>
        <li>Working together towards a common goal</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Commiting to a team while doing a fun sport can help you establish an
        excercise habit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Training in sports and exercise especially with a coach can help grow a
        growth mindset because you will know that even if you cannot do
        something today, you can practice and achieve it eventually!
      </p>
      <p>
        Learning from failure through sports can bring resilience and self
        awareness which can help you through all stages of life.
